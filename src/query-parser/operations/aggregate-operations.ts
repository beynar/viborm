/**
 * AggregateOperations - Aggregation and Analytics Operation Handler
 *
 * This component handles all aggregation and analytics operations including
 * count, aggregate, and groupBy. It manages the complexity of SQL aggregation
 * functions, grouping, filtering, and result formatting.
 *
 * SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
 * - count: Count records with optional filtering
 * - aggregate: Multiple aggregation functions (_count, _sum, _avg, _min, _max)
 * - groupBy: Group records and apply aggregations
 *
 * AGGREGATION FUNCTIONS:
 * - _count: Count records or non-null values in fields
 * - _sum: Sum numeric field values
 * - _avg: Average numeric field values
 * - _min: Minimum value in field
 * - _max: Maximum value in field
 *
 * FEATURES HANDLED:
 * - Field-specific aggregations
 * - Relation counting and aggregation
 * - GROUP BY with multiple fields
 * - HAVING clauses for group filtering
 * - Complex WHERE conditions with aggregations
 * - Nested aggregations in relations
 * - NULL handling in aggregations
 *
 * GROUPING CAPABILITIES:
 * - Single field grouping
 * - Multi-field grouping
 * - Date/time grouping (by day, month, year)
 * - Custom grouping expressions
 * - Hierarchical grouping
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Coordinates with clause builders for SQL generation
 * - Delegates field-specific logic to field handlers
 * - Manages relation aggregations through relation handlers
 * - Handles complex HAVING conditions
 *
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Index-aware aggregation planning
 * - Efficient GROUP BY ordering
 * - Subquery optimization for complex aggregations
 * - Materialized view hints for repeated aggregations
 *
 * RESULT FORMATTING:
 * - Type-safe result structures
 * - Null handling in aggregation results
 * - Nested aggregation result formatting
 * - Custom result field naming
