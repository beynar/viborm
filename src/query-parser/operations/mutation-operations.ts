/**
 * MutationOperations - Data Mutation Operation Handler
 *
 * This component handles all data mutation operations including create, update,
 * delete, and their batch variants. It manages the complexity of data validation,
 * relation mutations, and transaction coordination.
 *
 * SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
 * - create: Insert single record with relation handling
 * - createMany: Batch insert with conflict resolution
 * - update: Update single record by unique identifier
 * - updateMany: Batch update with WHERE conditions
 * - delete: Delete single record by unique identifier
 * - deleteMany: Batch delete with WHERE conditions
 *
 * FEATURES HANDLED:
 * - Field validation and type coercion
 * - Relation mutations (create, connect, disconnect, etc.)
 * - Batch operations with conflict handling
 * - Cascade operations for related data
 * - Optimistic locking for concurrent updates
 * - RETURNING clauses for created/updated data
 *
 * RELATION MUTATIONS:
 * - create: Create new related records
 * - connect: Link to existing records
 * - disconnect: Unlink from records
 * - connectOrCreate: Connect if exists, create if not
 * - update: Update related records
 * - delete: Delete related records
 * - set: Replace all relations
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Coordinates with field handlers for data processing
 * - Delegates relation mutations to relation handlers
 * - Manages transaction boundaries for complex operations
 * - Handles validation through field validators
 *
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Batch operations for multiple records
 * - Efficient conflict resolution strategies
 * - Minimal relation query generation
 * - Smart cascade operation planning
 *
 * SAFETY FEATURES:
 * - Data validation before mutation
 * - Constraint violation handling
 * - Rollback support for failed operations
 * - Audit trail for sensitive operations
