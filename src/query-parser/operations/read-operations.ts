/**
 * ReadOperations - Read Query Operation Handler
 *
 * This component handles all read-based database operations including findMany,
 * findFirst, findUnique, and their throwing variants. It orchestrates the
 * building of SELECT queries with all their associated clauses and features.
 *
 * SUPPORTED OPERATIONS:
 * - findMany: Retrieve multiple records with filtering, sorting, pagination
 * - findFirst: Retrieve the first matching record
 * - findUnique: Retrieve a single record by unique identifier
 * - findUniqueOrThrow: Same as findUnique but throws if not found
 * - findFirstOrThrow: Same as findFirst but throws if not found
 *
 * FEATURES HANDLED:
 * - Field selection (select clause)
 * - Relation inclusion (include clause with subqueries)
 * - Complex WHERE conditions with logical operators
 * - ORDER BY with relation ordering and null positioning
 * - Pagination (offset-based and cursor-based)
 * - DISTINCT field selection
 * - Nested relation queries with proper aliasing
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Coordinates with clause builders for SQL generation
 * - Delegates field-specific logic to field handlers
 * - Manages relation queries through relation handlers
 * - Handles pagination through pagination components
 *
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Unique query optimizations (LIMIT 1, index hints)
 * - Efficient subquery generation for relations
 * - Smart alias management to avoid conflicts
 * - Cursor pagination for large datasets
 *
 * EXTENSIBILITY:
 * - Easy to add new read operation types
 * - Pluggable pagination strategies
 * - Customizable query optimizations
 * - Support for database-specific features
