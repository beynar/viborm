Default
for nullable field that have default values as raw value, the raw value are only generated inside the ORM land 
therefore there is now way to ensure that the output is not null.
Types should reflect that and should annotate the base output as T | null
But if the default is a SQL statement this would be in the database land
therefore it is possible to certify the output is T

On the other hand. Default defined as SQL statement won't be available in the ORM land
Meaning that the output of the schema of a field with SQL statement as default will be of type T | undefined
