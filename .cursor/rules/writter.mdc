When I tell you to write a file, like a documentation or a new file I want you to actually crate the file without asking me for permission.

# BaseORM Developer Specifications

This folder contains detailed specifications for each component of the BaseORM project. These documents are designed to be comprehensive guides for developers working on individual parts of the system.


## Project Overview

BaseORM is a TypeScript ORM for Postgres and MySQL with two main components:

1. **Schema Builder** - A chainable API for defining models, fields, and relations
2. **Query Builder** - A Prisma-like interface for querying and mutating data

All components are designed to be fully type-safe, with TypeScript types inferred from schema definitions rather than generated.

## Key Principles

- **Type Safety**: All components must be fully type-safe and leverage TypeScript's type inference.
- **Chainable API**: All configuration must use a chainable, functional API (no decorators).
- **Prisma-like Query API**: The query interface should match Prisma's for familiarity.
- **Modular Design**: Components should be loosely coupled and independently testable.
- **MySQL/Postgres Support**: Focus on features supported by both databases.

## Development Guidelines

- All TypeScript types must be in the `/types` directory
- No decorators should be used anywhere in the codebase
- All components must have comprehensive unit tests
- Validation should be baked into the schema definition
- Code should follow the project's established patterns and naming conventions

## Example Usage

```ts
import { s } from "baseorm";

// Schema Definition
const user = s.model("user", {
  id: s.string().id().auto.ulid(),
  name: s.string(),
  email: s.string().validator(emailRegex),
  friends: s.relation.many(() => user),
});

// Query API Usage
const users = await orm.user.findMany({
  where: { name: "Alice" },
  include: { friends: true },
});
```

## Future Features (Not Required for Initial Implementation)

- SQL Migration Generation
- Transactions
- Lifecycle Hooks
- Telemetry
