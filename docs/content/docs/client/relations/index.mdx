# Relation Queries

Query and filter data across related models.

## Overview

VibORM supports filtering on relations with operators that depend on the relation cardinality.

## To-One Relations

For `oneToOne` and `manyToOne` relations:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `is` | Match related record |
| `isNot` | Exclude matching related record |

## To-Many Relations

For `oneToMany` and `manyToMany` relations:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `some` | At least one match |
| `every` | All must match |
| `none` | No matches |

## Quick Examples

```ts
// Users with admin profile
await client.user.findMany({
  where: {
    profile: {
      is: { role: "ADMIN" },
    },
  },
});

// Users with at least one published post
await client.user.findMany({
  where: {
    posts: {
      some: { published: true },
    },
  },
});

// Posts with all approved comments
await client.post.findMany({
  where: {
    comments: {
      every: { approved: true },
    },
  },
});
```
