# 3. Relation Class â€” Developer Specification

## Introduction

The Relation Class is responsible for defining relationships between models, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. It must support implicit many-to-many relations with customizable junction table and field names, as well as cascade options for delete/update. The Relation Class must be type-safe, chainable, and support circular/self-references.

---

## Goals

- **Type Safety:** All relation definitions must be fully type-safe and infer their types for use in models and queries.
- **Chainable API:** Relation configuration must use a chainable, functional API.
- **Implicit Many-to-Many:** Support implicit many-to-many relations with customizable junction table/field names.
- **Cascade Options:** Support cascade on delete/update with configurable options.
- **Extensibility:** The Relation Class must be easily extensible for future features.

## Implementation Rules

### 1. Directory & File Structure

- All Relation Class code must reside in `/src/schema/relation.ts`.
- All relation type helpers must be in `/src/types/`.
- No code outside these directories may define or modify relation logic.

### 2. Relation Class API

- Implement a `Relation` class (or factory) with chainable methods for:
  - Defining one-to-one: `.one(() => Model)`
  - Defining one-to-many: `.many(() => Model)`
  - Defining many-to-many: `.many(() => Model)` (with implicit junction table)
  - Setting the referenced field: `.on(fieldName)`
  - Setting the referenced field in the target model: `.ref(fieldName)`
  - Setting cascade options: `.cascade({ onDelete: "CASCADE" | "SET NULL" | "RESTRICT", onUpdate: ... })`
  - Naming the junction table and fields: `.junctionTable(name)`, `.junctionField(name)`
- All methods must be chainable and return a new Relation instance with updated configuration.

### 3. Implicit Many-to-Many

- Many-to-many relations must automatically create a junction table with a default name (`$REFFIELD_TABLE_NAME`), but allow customization.
- Junction fields must have sensible defaults but be customizable.

### 4. Type Inference

- The Relation Class must use TypeScript generics to infer the relation's type at compile time.
- The resulting model type must reflect all relation types and constraints.

### 5. Cascade Options

- Cascade options must be configurable for both delete and update.
- Defaults should be "RESTRICT" unless specified.

### 6. Extensibility

- The Relation Class must be designed to allow future features (e.g., new relation types, hooks).
- All internal state must be accessible for future introspection.

## Example Usage

```ts
import { s } from "baseorm";

const user = s.model("user", {
  friends: s.relation
    .many(() => user)
    .junctionTable("user_friends")
    .junctionField("friend_id")
    .cascade({ onDelete: "CASCADE" }),
  lover: s.relation
    .one(() => user)
    .on("id")
    .ref("id")
    .cascade({ onDelete: "SET NULL" }),
});
```

---

## Deliverables

- `relation.ts` in `/src/schema/`
- All relation type helpers in `/src/types/`
- Full TypeScript support and type inference
- Unit tests for all relation features

---

## Prohibited

- No decorators
- No runtime type generation (all types must be inferred at compile time)
- No code outside `/src/schema/` and `/src/types/` may define relation logic

---

## Review Checklist

- [ ] All relation definitions are type-safe and chainable
- [ ] All relation type helpers are in `/types/`
- [ ] Cascade options are configurable and testable
- [ ] No decorators are used
- [ ] Example usage compiles and infers correct types
