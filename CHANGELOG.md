# Changelog

All notable changes to VibORM are recorded here. Releases follow Semantic
Versioning.

## Unreleased

- Prepare the V1 release and publication system.
- The SQLite drivers (`sqlite3`, `bun-sqlite`, `d1`, `libsql`) no longer
  normalize `count`/`exist` results in their driver-level `parseResult`
  middleware. The query engine's decoder owns the meaning of a count and an
  exists answer — it asks for its own `_count` alias and reads it back — so
  those answers are unchanged on every SQLite driver. The
  `DriverResultParser.parseResult` contract itself is untouched: a consumer
  that wrapped `driver.result.parseResult` is still asked once per operation
  with the provider's raw result, and is unaffected in outcome. The shipped
  `parseResult` function itself no longer exists on those drivers: a wrapper
  that captured it before installing its own must check for its absence
  before calling it.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-01-24

- Published the initial development package.
