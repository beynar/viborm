# Albert's procedural memory

- Before a large refactor or dependency restore, verify that the workspace has
  enough durable free space for installs, build output, and test databases. If a
  write fails with `ENOSPC`, stop and ask for space to be freed. Do not delete
  dependency trees, generated output, or user files as an improvised recovery.
