/**
 * The route inventory (PLAN P6 needs this pinned, not prose). Every write shape
 * the P3/P4 reports recorded as routed to V1 is exercised here through V2's
 * CONSTRUCTION path (an {@link UnsupportedOperationError} at construction is what
 * the per-tree router hands to V1 — no I/O is needed to observe the route). The
 * absorbed shapes (M2M create/connectOrCreate/upsert; compound-FK
 * set/update/delete/upsert; a compound FK referencing a non-PK unique) must now
 * construct on V2; the ONE inexpressible sub-shape (createManyAndReturn
 * skipDuplicates on a non-returning driver) must still route.
 *
 * The assertion is the whole point: the set of corpus shapes that still route is
 * EXACTLY the one documented boundary. It is the P4 `routedToV1StillRemaining`
 * list minus the two P4.5 absorbs.
 *
 * Scope note (CORRECTED, P6-prerequisite 2): this file pins the *tracked* route
 * inventory (the P3/P4 report set) and the throw-SITE COUNT. It does NOT, on its
 * own, prove those throws carry no reachable behavior — and the earlier framing
 * that the untracked throws were "outside the P6 deletion accounting" was the
 * exact blind spot both blocked P6 attempts hit. A throw site is a route to V1;
 * many of the untracked ones (parent-held to-one `create`/`connectOrCreate`,
 * inverse-side to-one ops, nested-relation upsert arms) route ACCEPT-AND-EXECUTE
 * shapes V1 runs correctly today, so they ARE part of the deletion accounting.
 * The genuine per-SHAPE accounting — which declines carry reachable behavior and
 * which are truly refusable/degenerate — lives in the decline-surface gate
 * ({@link file://./decline-surface-gate.test.ts}), which runs shapes with the V1
 * fallback DISABLED. This file remains the count tripwire; that gate is the
 * behavior-reachability invariant. P6 may delete V1 only when that gate's
 * `FALLBACK_CARRYING_RESIDUAL` is empty — it is not.

/**
 * Full-client-surface inventory (P6 precondition).

 * The route inventory above pins the *tracked* write-shape routes: shapes a
 * V2-owned operation DECLINES with {@link UnsupportedOperationError} at
 * construction. By construction it cannot see an operation family that falls
 * back to V1 by OMISSION from {@link ROUTED_OPERATIONS} — such a family produces
 * no throw and is invisible to a throw-site census. That blind spot is exactly
 * what let a P6 work order assert "exactly ONE route to V1 remains" while the
 * entire `create` family was, and is, dispatched to V1's frozen OperationRuntime
 * (via `pending-operation.ts`, a P6 KEEP file, when `resolveV2()` returns
 * undefined). This block closes the hole: it enumerates the ENTIRE client
 * operation surface and asserts each family either constructs on V2 or is a
 * listed, deliberate V1 fallback — so the fallback set can never again be
 * silent.
 *
 * P6 implication (the reason this is a *precondition*, not decoration): a family
 * in {@link DOCUMENTED_V1_FALLBACK} means V1's operation/execution root is still
 * reachable and therefore NOT deletable. P6 ("bulk-delete V1's operation/
 * execution root once unreachable") may proceed only when this set is empty —
 * or when a family in it is a recorded maintainer decision to keep it on V1
 * permanently (which would itself change P6's "runtimes 2→1" premise and must be
 * recorded, not silent). This assertion is decision-neutral: it neither migrates
 * `create` nor blesses it as permanent; it only makes the true state a pinned,
 * reviewable fact. The day the set changes, both this file and that decision
 * must move together.
